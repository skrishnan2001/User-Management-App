# User-Management-App
A simple CRUD app to manage the basic user details, developed using Java, JSP, Servlets (JSF) and bootstrap.

## MVC Overview
- Model View Controller(MVC) is a pattern used in software engineering to seperate the application logic from the user interface. As the name implies, the MVC has 3 layers.
- The Model defines the business layer of the application, the Controller manages the flow of the application, and the View defines the presentation layer of the application.

Some of the key features of the pattern
- It seperates the presentation layer from the business layer.
- The Controller performs the action of invoking the Model and sending data to View.
- The Model is not even aware that it is used by some web application or a desktop application.
